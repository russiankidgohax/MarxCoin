# Tokenomics

## Token Design

### Initial Supply and Max Supply

#### Options

- 2.8 billion (according to ChatGPT that was the value of rubles in US dollar)
- 18830314, Death date of Karl Marx
- equal to circulating supply
- 19911226, Perestroika and end of Soviet Union
- equal to ciculating supply 1 billion

### Circulating Supply

- How much in the market at given moment in time
- Circulating supply affects supply and demand most
- If circulating supply is much less than max supply then inflation can occur
- Ethereum does not have inflation, even though it is uncapped

### Minting Strategy

- No mint
